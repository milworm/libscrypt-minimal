* libscrypt-minimal
C implementation of the scrypt key derivation function as a library.

Tries to isolate the the key derivation function from the code of the "scrypt" utility written by C. Percival.

* Status
Earliest stage - Does not pass any tests yet.
./build/make.sh creates a library, ./build/install.sh installs it, there is a header file that can be included, and using the provided "scrypt" function in a c program, /something/ is returned.
